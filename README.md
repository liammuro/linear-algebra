### VECTORS

DEFINITION: A VECTOR $\vec{v}$ is a directed segment that corresponds to a displacement from one point $A$ to another point $B$

We define two vectors to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction

Def: A vector whose initial and terminal coincide is called a zero vector; it has zero magnitude but an arbitrary direction, i.e. no direction
